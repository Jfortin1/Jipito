### Why
I want to share pieces of code that I find really useful/cool

### What

#### Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter (Iterated moving average) : [kz.R](https://github.com/Jfortin1/Jipito/blob/master/R/kz.R)

I like this filter a lot and used it in my [recent paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/03/019000) to smooth the first eigenvector of several genomic matrices.
